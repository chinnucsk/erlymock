<h1>ErlyMock - An EasyMock inspired mocking library.</h1>

<p> ErlyMock was built to be helpful for Test Driven Development. I know this
goal is by no means yet reached, so I ask you kindly to support this
project. All suggestions, complaints and improvements are welcome. </p>

<p>
ErlyMock is the latest incarnation of an Erlang mocking library inspired by
Easymock for Java. It is used in unit tests to verify that a set of functions is
called by the code under test in correct order and with correct parameters.
</p>
<p>
With ErlyMock it is possible to declare the behavior of arbitrary
modules/functions with or without expecting acutal invocations. The user simply
declares what each function call to some function should return or do at the
beginning of a unit test.
</p>
<h2>Some features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>API documentation</li>
<li>battle proven in at least three large projects at http://www.lindenbaum.eu</li>
<li>comprehensive runtime messages</li>
<li>two-letter module name(we went from 'mock' to 'em', which was quite an improvement for us)</li>
<li>small, flexible and easy to use API</li>
<li>allows strict expectations</li>
<li>allows stub behavior definitions to be intuitively mixed with strict expectations</li>
<li>correctly restores cover compiled module</li>
<li>automatic cleanup when mock or test process dies</li>
<li>implemented with OTP standard behaviour</li>
<li>rebar enabled</li></ul>

<h2>Usage example:</h2>

<p>Assume there are two modules, used by the code to be tested, that shall be mocked (at least to prevent damaging side effects):</p>

A rocket launcher server:
<pre>
-module(rocket_launcher).

launch(Longitude, Latitude, Type) -&gt;
 ....
</pre>
And A UI module:
<pre>
-module(rocket_launcher_ui).

ask_for_instructions() -&gt;
 ...
</pre>
Then this is how a happy case unit test might look like:
<pre>
launche_missle_test() -&gt;
   % create a new mock process
   M = em:new(),

   % define the expectations
   em:strict(M, rocket_launcher_ui, ask_for_instructions, [],
            {return, [{longitude, 123},
                      {latitude, 999},
                      {type, some_rocket_type}]}),
   em:strict(M, missle_lauchner, launch, [123, 999, some_rocket_type]),

   % tell the mock that all expectations are defined
   em:replay(M),

   % run code under test
   rocket_app:interactive(),

   % verify expectations immediately
   em:verify(M).
</pre>

<p>Another example shall show the usefulness of <a href="em.html#await_expectations-1"><code>em:await_expectations/1</code></a>
instead of <a href="em.html#verify-1"><code>em:verify/1</code></a> to wait for asynchronous invokations and <a href="em.html#zelf-1"><code>em:zelf/1</code></a> as argument matcher matching the process id of the process calling
the mocked functions in the replay phase.</p>

<pre>

%% Let's look at the impl first:
-module(xxx_impl).



download_image(Url) -&gt;
    gen_server:cast(?MODULE, {download, URL}).

%% ...

handle_cast({download, URL}, State) -&gt;
    net_io:schedule_download(Url, self()),
    {noreply, State}.

%%%%%%%%%% Now this 'cast' happens asynchronously using 'em:verify/1' would not
%%%%%%%%%% help a lot, it would be pure luck if the erlang scheduler executed
%%%%%%%%%% that handle_cast before. This is the case where
%%%%%%%%%% em:await_expectations/1 comes in handy...

%% Let's look at the test first:

downld_img_test() -&gt;
   % create a new mock process
    M = em:new(),

    Url = test_url,

    em:strict(M, net_io, schedule_download,
              [Url,
               %% em:zelf() will match 'self()' of the process under test!
               em:zelf()]),

    em:replay(M),

    %% call code under test
    xxx_impl:download_image(Url),

    %% await the cast to happen:
    em:await_expectations(M).

</pre>

<h2> More Support for asynchronous calls </h2>

<p>See <a href="em.html#await-2"><code>em:await/2</code></a> for details.</p>

<p>When gen_server:cast's and gen_event:handle_event calls decorate the module
under test one is often in the need to wait for an operation to happen before
triggering the next operation.</p>

<p>One example is when the code under test casts a message, and receive's event
caused by the cast later. In this situation it is desirable to not call the
server shutdown code until the event was received and the corresponding
expections are met.</p>

<p>This is where the fact that <a href="em.html#strict-4"><code>em:strict/4</code></a> returns a handle for the
expectation comes in handy, because <a href="em.html#await-2"><code>em:await/2</code></a> can be used to block the
test process until that specific invokation was by the code under test.</p>

<p><i>... ok I give up explaining... COME CODE:</i></p>

<strong>xxx Impl</strong>
<pre>
-module(xxx).
...
op(Pid) -&gt;
  gen_server:cast(Pid, op).
...
handle_cast(op, State) -&gt;
    collab1:do_a(),
    collab2:do_b(),
    {noreply, State}.
</pre>

<strong>xxx Test</strong>
<pre>

op_twice_test() -&gt;
  M = em:new(),

  em:strict(M, collab1, do_a, []),

  DoneB =
    em:strict(M, collab2, do_b, []),

  em:replay(M),

  {ok, Pid} = xxx:start(),

  op(Pid),
  em:await(M, DoneB),

  exit(Pid, kill),
  em:verify(M).

</pre>

<h2>History</h2>

<p> ErlyMock has undergone many stages and years of development and usage before
reaching this stage.</p>

<p> It was first published here:
http://sheyll.blogspot.com/2009/02/erlang-mock-erlymock.html Then Samual Rivas
cleaned it up and added support for restoring cover compiled modules for his
project, see http://www.lambdastream.com/. </p>

<p>The code was then added with all modifications to the great new
erlang-maven-plugin forge which can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/erlang-plugin/.  </p>

<p> Then I decided to partially rewrite ErlyMock in order to provide a simpler
API and in order to improve the code quality. Also, I wanted to use the gen_fsm
OTP standard behavior.</p>

<p> Later loxybjorn on github added rebar support, now erlymock could automatically be added to rebar projects.</p>

<p> Several improvements were added by Olle T√∂rnstr√∂m, who helped fixing module purging issues.</p>

<p> Finally I decided to remove maven support, and to rely totally on rebar.</p>

<strong>Thanks to all who helped with erlymock.</strong>
